# Slack - How to create a channel

This guides you on how to create a **channel** in Slack. Slack is a channel-based messaging platform. Slack channels are dedicated spaces where you can chat, share files, and start video and audio calls. 

Every Slack workspace starts with a #general channel, which is the only channel that members are automatically added to and unable to leave. 

## Pre-Requisites
- Make sure you have a Slack account or you can connect via other third party (Gmail, Apple, ...)
- Connect to any slack workspace





## Steps to create a Channel
1. From your sidebar, click **Channels > Create > Create channel**

**Channel Visibility**

**Public**: Open to any member in your workspace to view and join. Messages or files shared in a public channel can also be searched by other members of your workspace. 

**Private**: Members in your workspace can only view or join by invitation. Messages or files shared in a private channel can only be searched by members of that channel. Note: Your account administrator may limit you from creating private channels, so if you don't have that option, that's probably why.

4. Optionally, invite members or guests to the channel by entering their name or email address. Or click **Skip for now**
